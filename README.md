ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ayan Shaikh!
I'm a student in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering, making a pivot into Web3 development and blockchain technology. My journey began with front-end skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Iâ€™m now expanding into the world of Solidity and smart contract development as I work towards a career in Web3.



### What Iâ€™m Working On
Currently diving deep into blockchain fundamentals, exploring decentralized technologies, and sharpening my skills in Solidity for building smart contracts. Iâ€™m excited to contribute to the Web3 ecosystem and bring innovative ideas to life.


### Tech Stack:
HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Solidity (in progress)


### What I Do for Fun
When I'm not coding, you can find me:

    - Playing video games or diving into sci-fi novels
    -Experimenting with DIY electronics projects
    - Play contact sports like football
